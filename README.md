## üì¨ Developer Notes!!! (Updated)

Hi dear reader! A quick note that I just changed the name of the game from "Fear the Unknown" to "Eclipsed Apocalypse". This is a small update, and is noted here just to let you know in case you stumble upon the old name in places, where I did not get the chance to change it yet.

- Animations of NPCs and the Main Character within the game and cutscenes, will be made using Mixamo's rigged animation models. I will apply them to the characters' 3D models, which are made in Blender.

## üìñ The Story... (in progress)

The story takes place in 1965 - USSR, as you (the head soviet scientist at the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakh SSR) suddenly receive communication from the planet 25 million light years away from Earth, after years of waiting since your team carelessly sent out radiowaves with our Solar System's coordinates at the start of the Space Race. However, you don't know whether you should be ecstatic with this truly revolutionary news... or petrified. What you along with anyone with equivalent technology (the Americans) received, are the instructions on how to build a portal that will create a bidirectional gateway with the unknown race. The only suitable place to build this portal was assumed to be the Earth's only moon. This fueled the space race between the two post-WW2 powers. However, after many tragic failures of the first Apollo and Soviet space missions, the Americans landed on the moon first. The hearts of scientists from both nations skipped the beat as they all sat waiting to see what would happen next. However, after 3 days of silence, it was concluded that the mission was unsuccessful. Thus, the simple fact that they landed was used as the notion to cover up the actual purpose of this mission. 

March 3rd, 1969 - A large crew of scientists (including you) from the Soviet side lands on the moon. And through using the forced labor of people trapped in Gulag concentration camps, you were able to develop the missing piece. The portal is now working. You request at least a few years to fully inspect the other side to confirm that the civilization that sent you the instructions is safe from the higher-ups. However, the government gives you 2 months to satisfy their egos and use this notion as the thing that will win the space race. Shocked, you have no choice but to conduct a brief experiment by sending a drone rover with a camera through the portal. But before that, you saw that a young unknown soldier was appointed to blow up a Tsar 2 thermo-nuclear bomb in case something unimaginable that will threaten the extinction of the human race comes through the gateway. We gave that sequence of events a code name "Tsardown". Hearing that command would mean ultimate destruction. 

_(the story is in progress, please expect corrections and additions as I make further developments!)._
